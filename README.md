# Perceptron
A Basic Perceptron with Python

#### Main.py
Shows how to use **Perceptron.py**

#### Perceptron.py
Contains the Perceptron using a simple learning rule

## How to use
You can pull the repository the way it is. Running **Main.py** calls the Perceptron with the iris dataset. If you just want to use the Perceptron you have to call `fit()` with a Numpy Array `X` (m_samples, n_features) and a Numpy Array `y` (m_samples).
